Trim the excess fat from the chicken and put the pieces in a large bowl.

Place a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat and add the oil. When small bubbles appear at the bottom of the pan,
add the cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom, and sauté for 1 minute. When the spices change color and are fragrant, add the onions
and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown. Add the ginger paste and garlic paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring
continuously.

Add the turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chile powder. Stir well.

Add the tomatoes and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring continuously. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes or until the oil comes to the top.

Add the chicken and salt, and stir. Increase the heat to high and sauté for 5 minutes or until the chicken pieces are well coated
with the sauce. Add 1½ cups (300 ml) water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes or until the
chicken is cooked through.

Transfer to a serving bowl. Sprinkle with the garam masala and garnish with the cilantro. Serve hot.
